# Woodchopper-game
It's rock paper scissor, but for log-lovers! In this game you have to choose between Axe, Wood or Water:

Rulez:
1. Axe chops trees, but gets rusty in the water. 
2. Wood consumes water, but won't stand a change in a fight against the master axe
3. Water will make axe dull in the long run, but can't escape the thirst of the woods

Forget ps5, forget vr, forget your games that are perfect in your dreams coz you won't ever play anything as forward thinking, as graphically advanced and creative than this game! 
...Also it's only played in browser console so you don't have to make up any excuses for spending little bit more time with your favorite browser (I hope it's not a Microsoft Explorer)!  

In all seriousness: 

In this project I would like to test my Javascript knowledge that I've gained so far (which isn't much, but hey we all gotta start somewhere). 

Stuff like basics of data types, conditionals, variables & functions! Who knows maynbe I learn something new on the way!
